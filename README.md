# Slotify

Slotify is a front-end scheduling application designed to demonstrate clean UI flow, state management, and user interaction using only vanilla web technologies. The goal of this project is to build a simple, intuitive meeting scheduler where users can enter an email, select a date, book a time slot, and manage their appointments through a calendar view. The project focuses on clarity, usability, and visual polish without relying on frameworks or back-end services. All data is handled locally to keep the application lightweight and easy to understand.

# Built With

Visual Studio Code
HTML (multi-screen layout using sections)
CSS (modern light theme, responsive layout, grid-based calendar)
JavaScript (screen state management, localStorage persistence, booking logic)

# About the Lead Developer

Valentin Rama is a Berea College Computer Science student with a strong focus on front-end web development and UI/UX fundamentals. This project highlights the ability to design structured user flows, manage application state on the client side, and create polished interfaces using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Slotify reflects an emphasis on simplicity, readability, and real-world usability.

# Scope

The application uses multiple screens (welcome, email login, scheduling, and calendar) managed entirely on the front end.
Users can select a date and book available 30-minute time slots between business hours.
Appointments are stored using localStorage, allowing persistence across page refreshes.
A calendar view displays booked appointments and allows users to delete them with a single click.
No external APIs or frameworks are used.

# Vision

The vision for Slotify is to demonstrate how a clean, user-friendly scheduling experience can be built with minimal tools. The project serves as a portfolio piece that emphasizes layout structure, state control, and thoughtful UI design. Future enhancements could include authentication, back-end integration, real-time availability, or framework-based refactors.
